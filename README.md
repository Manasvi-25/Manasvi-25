## ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Manasvi :) 

 a Computer Science student at Stony Brook University with a passion for problem-solving, collaboration, and building technology that makes life better.

Iâ€™m currently exploring software engineering, AI, and machine learning. As an AI/ML Fellow at Break Through Tech AI @ Cornell, Iâ€™m gaining hands-on experience working with real-world datasets and tools. I'm especially interested in building impactful projects--from accessibility tools and education tech to mental health apps and platforms for social good. If it helps people, improves systems, or lets me do the work I love while fitting my vibe, I want to build it.

Beyond tech, I love working with people and for people. Whether itâ€™s helping first-year students navigate college as an Undergraduate Fellow and Registration Workshop Assistant or supporting inclusive innovation as part of the AI Community @ SBU, collaboration and mentorship are a big part of what drives me.

In my free time, youâ€™ll probably find me writing fiction and poetry, sketching, or playing puzzle games like Nerdle and its quirky spin-offs.

# ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: WorkTimely â€“ A Personal Productivity Companion
What Iâ€™m Building: Started as a basic stopwatch in Java (June 2025), now evolving into a Pomodoro timer + aesthetic daily planner that mimics the feel of paper journals but with smarter features.

Tools: Java, Java Swing, OOP, GUI Design

Current Progress:

â€“ Built a working stopwatch with start/stop/reset and a clean Swing interface

â€“Working on adding Pomodoro mode and a simple task planner

â€“ Focused on making the UX warm, personal, and not robotic
